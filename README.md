**Description**

This is an implementation of the ADVENT dissemination protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using the Veins simulator. Such implementation is based on the following publication:

Maia, G., Rezende, C., Villas, L.A., Boukerche, A., Viana, A.C., Aquino, A.L. and Loureiro, A.A., 2013, November. Traffic aware video dissemination over vehicular ad hoc networks. In Proceedings of the 16th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (pp. 419-426).

**Dependencies**

1. OMNeT++ 4.4.2
2. Veins 4.4
3. SUMO 0.25.0

**Warning**

The scenarios used to run the protocol (Manhattan Grid and TAPAS Cologne) are not available in the repository. You must create your own scenarios and adapt the protocol accordingly or ask me for the scenario files.
